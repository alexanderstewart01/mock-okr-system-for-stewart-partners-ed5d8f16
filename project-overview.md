# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock OKR System for Stewart & Partners

Description: A web application that *simulates* an OKR management system tailored for Stewart & Partners, an architecture studio. The app will allow users to set Objectives and Key Results, track progress, and visualize performance, all within a user-friendly interface. Key features like role-based OKR templates, a scoring system, and Notion integration will be mocked.

Features:
*   Mock User Roles: Simulate different user roles (Partners, Architects, Support Staff) with customized OKR templates.
*   Mock OKR Templates: Design templates with pre-defined objectives and key results based on the provided brief.
*   Mock Progress Tracking:  A percentage-based scoring system (0-100%) for tracking progress quarterly.
*   Mock Notion Integration: Simulate a dashboard displaying data from Notion (project names, deadlines, etc.).
*   Mock Training Integration: A course completion tracker for Revit, SOPs, etc.
*   Mock Reporting: Generate snapshot reports for quarterly reviews and incentives.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
